(1) Prompt the user to enter a string of their choosing. Output the string.

Ex:
```
Enter a sentence or phrase:
The only thing we have to fear is fear itself.

You entered: The only thing we have to fear is fear itself.
```
(2) Complete the getNumOfCharacters() method, which returns the number of letters in the user's string. We encourage you to use a for loop in this function. _Hint: a previous lesson covered Character methods._

(3) In main(), call the getNumOfCharacters() method and then output the returned result.

(4) Implement the outputWithoutWhitespace() method, which outputs the string's characters except for whitespace (spaces, tabs). Note: A tab is '\t'. Call the outputWithoutWhitespace() method in main().

Ex:
```
Enter a sentence or phrase:
The only thing we have to fear is fear itself.

You entered: The only thing we have to fear is fear itself.

Number of characters: 36
String with no whitespace: Theonlythingwehavetofearisfearitself.
```
