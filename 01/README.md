(1) Prompt the user to input an integer, a double, a character, and a string, storing each into separate variables. Then, output those four values on a single line separated by a space.*Note* Be sure to use println() for your prompts. *Hint: don't use nextLine() in this program.*

Note: This program outputs a newline after each input. The examples below show the user's input, but that actually isn't part of the output when the program runs.
```
Enter integer:
99
Enter double:
3.77
Enter character:
z
Enter string:
Howdy
99 3.77 z Howdy
```

(2) Extend to also output in reverse.
```
Enter integer:
99
Enter double:
3.77
Enter character:
z
Enter string:
Howdy
99 3.77 z Howdy
Howdy z 3.77 99
```
(3) Extend to cast the double to an integer, and output that integer.
```
Enter integer:
99
Enter double:
3.77
Enter character:
z
Enter string:
Howdy
99 3.77 z Howdy
Howdy z 3.77 99
3.77 cast to an integer is 3
```
