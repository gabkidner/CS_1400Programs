(1) Use scnr.nextLine() to get a line of user input into a string. Output the line.

Ex:
```
Enter text:
IDK if I'll go. It's my BFF's birthday.
You entered: IDK if I'll go. It's my BFF's birthday.
```
(2) Search the string (using indexOf()) for common abbreviations and print a list of each found abbreviation along with its decoded meaning.

Ex:
```
Enter text:
IDK if I'll go. It's my BFF's birthday.
You entered: IDK if I'll go. It's my BFF's birthday.
BFF: best friend forever
IDK: I don't know
```
Support these abbreviations:

* BFF -- best friend forever
* IDK -- I don't know
* JK -- just kidding
* TMI -- too much information
* TTYL -- talk to you later
